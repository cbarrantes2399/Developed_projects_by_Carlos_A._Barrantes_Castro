## usage: [X,z] = gendata(numSamples[,noise])
##
## Generate simulated depth data.  For each position in a row of X, the
## normalized z coordinate is returned.  0 means the deepest value and
## 1 the highest value.
##
## Optionally you can provide the level of desired data noise in the z
## direction, which by default is set to 1/256.
##
## The generated data consists of 2D grid positions in the rows of X,
## and the corresponding z value at that position.  The order of the
## 2D positions in X is completely random (except for the reference data).
##
## The mandatory argument is a number, that indicates the absolute
## number of samples (if the provided number is greater than 1), or
## the percentage of total samples (if the provided number is less or
## equal than 1).  If exactly 1 is provided, then all data without
## noise is created.
##
## Optionally you can provide how much noise you want on the depth
## measurement (noiseZ) and on the plane (noiseP)

  ## Filter the profile to smooth out the 8-bit boundaries

  ## Get the complete data grid
  [xx,yy] = meshgrid(1:columns(F),1:rows(F));
